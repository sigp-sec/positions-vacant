# Wanted: Rust Security Engineer

Do you love writing and reviewing Rust code? Want to secure the future of blockchain technology? Sigma Prime is seeking skilled Rust engineers to join our team. You'll play a crucial role in assessing the security of blockchain projects developed in Rust. Deep blockchain expertise isn’t a must - bring your Rust skills and curiosity, and we’ll help you grow into the decentralised world.


## About Us

**Sigma Prime** is a leading blockchain and security research firm,  dedicated to building a secure and decentralised world. Since 2015, Ethereum has been a focal point of our work, and we've partnered with some of the leading companies in the blockchain space, offering security reviews, design consultancy, and niche development services in a range of technical capacities.

Our flagship project, [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.sigmaprime.io/), written in Rust, stands as one of the premier Ethereum consensus clients. Backed by grant funding from the Ethereum Foundation, Protocol Guild, ConsenSys, and private contributors, Lighthouse powers staking for institutions and individuals alike, and is a testament to our commitment to excellence and security in decentralised systems.

Our information security practice provides assessment services targeting the following:

* Smart contracts (EVM and non-EVM)
* Zero-knowledge systems
* Layer 1 & Layer 2 protocols
* Blockchain software (nodes, client implementations)
* Novel P2P network and cryptographic primitives
* Cloud & on-prem infrastructure
* Social engineering & red team exercises
* Fuzz testing

We are a safe place regardless of your ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or any other characteristic that makes you happy and harms no-one.


## The Role

As a Rust Security Engineer at Sigma Prime, you’ll use your Rust and security expertise to protect cutting-edge systems. We are looking for engineers who can dive deep into Rust code and apply robust security principles. Blockchain experience is a welcome bonus, but not required.

If you’re passionate about Rust and eager to secure the decentralised future, this role is for you.


### Responsibilities

* Review Rust codebases for security vulnerabilities.
* Apply security best practices to harden decentralised projects.
* Develop advanced fuzzing harnesses to assist with vulnerability identification.
* Contribute to enhancing the security posture of Lighthouse, our Ethereum consensus client.
* Collaborate on tools and processes while exploring blockchain tech.


### Requirements

- **Must-Have**: Strong Rust skills and experience writing, debugging, or reviewing systems-level code.
- **Must-Have**: Solid understanding of information security principles (e.g., common vulnerabilities, secure coding practices).
- A proactive, curious, problem-solving mindset and willingness to learn and grow.
- **Bonus**: Experience with blockchain protocols, smart contracts (e.g., Solidity), or fuzzing tools.


## Location

This role offers flexibility: work remotely from anywhere or join us in Sydney, NSW, Australia. Our HQ is in Sydney, but our remote crew is an integral part of our collaborative environment.
