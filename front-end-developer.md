be to contribute to open-source software in the Ethereum community. Candidates

and web-app development.

## The Company

decentralised world.

Ethereum has been a focus of ours since 2015, and we have provided security

locally and internationally.

Our latest project, Lighthouse, is an Ethereum 2.0 client built using Rust. The
project is already established and development has begun; the open-source
repository can be found at [github.com/sigp/lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse). We are honoured to have
received multiple grants from the Ethereum Foundation that enable us to expand our
development capabilities.

## The Role

We are looking to expand our core team by hiring a web developer who shares
our passion for decentralised systems, and whose development skills compliment
those of our team.

You may fit the role if you:
 - Have experience using the React framework.

 - Are passionate about Ethereum, proof-of-stake blockchains, and/or decentralised systems.

Bonus Skills:
 - Experience or knowledge in using blockchain clients/wallets/DApps.
 - Strong graphic design skills.
 - Project management experience.

This role is for a Front End Developer whose role will be to develop user
interfaces and an occasional website for various low-level tools being
constructed at Sigma Prime as well as help manage and maintain a user-facing
front end for the Lighthouse blockchain client.

The ideal candidate would be an Ethereum enthusiast with experience in
DApp/client front-end development using the React framework, and an interest in
supporting the blockchain community through open source development.
