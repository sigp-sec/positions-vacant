# Wanted: Lighthouse Support Technician

[Lighthouse]: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse
[Sigma Prime]: https://sigmaprime.io/
[ethstaker]: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/

[Sigma Prime]() is hiring a *support technician* to provide support to
[Lighthouse]() users and the broader staking
community. This position might be for you if you're an active member of the
Ethereum staking community with experience using Lighthouse.

## The Company

**Sigma Prime** maintains [Lighthouse][], an Ethereum consensus client with a
broad user-base and a reputation as a leading Ethereum implementation.  Sigma
Prime also provides top-tier information security services to high-profile
blockchains and blockchain applications.

We are inclusive organisation that cares deeply about the impact we have on our
staff, users and the community.

## The Role

With this role, we are looking to achieve (in no particular order):

- Provide a higher standard of support and documentation to Lighthouse users.
- Increase our contributions to non-Lighthouse-specific Ethereum support and documentation.
- Reduce the impact that support and documentation has on our Rust developers.

We are open to part-time or full-time applicants.

Presently, **we are only considering candidates who can demonstrate a history of
contributing to Ethereum proof-of-stake support efforts**. This will likely
involve the candidate sharing their Discord/Reddit/Github/etc handle to
demonstrate a history of contribution.

We are particularly interested in [ethstaker][] contributors for this position.
We love ethstaker and would welcome any existing contributors to keep
contributing to ethstaker if they were to take this role.

The ideal candidate would have the following attributes:

- Experience running Lighthouse in a staking environment (testnets and/or mainnet).
- Experience with other Ethereum consensus implementations (e.g., Lodestar, Nimbus, Teku, Prysm).
- A history of helping users on any of the client or ethstaker Discord servers.
- A passion for working with people to solve both simple and complex issues.
- An interest in testing new, unreleased software to help detect bugs and improve UX.
- A kind, caring and helpful demeanour.
- Strong written English and conversational verbal English.
- A talent for producing concise, high-quality documentation.
- A history of working in professional technical support roles.
- A passion for Ethereum.

The primary objectives of this role are (in no particular order):

- Provide support to users through the [Lighthouse Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cyAszAh).
- Contribute to the [Lighthouse documentation](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io).
- Provide user-testing for new Lighthouse features before they are released.
- Contribute to open-source Ethereum staking initiatives like [ethstaker][].

Lighthouse is only one facet of what we do at Sigma Prime. A successful
candidate will have the ability to work across the different aspects of the
company and may be asked to contribute to non-Lighthouse activites from time to
time.

## Locations

Sigma Prime is composed of many individuals across the world. We all work
remotely and structure meetings and events to suit multiple timezones.

We are particularily interested in candidates with working hours in European or
American time-zones. These time-zones are highly
