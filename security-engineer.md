# Wanted: Blockchain Security Engineer

Sigma Prime is hiring a security engineer to expand its security assessment
practice. If you're into blockchain security, penetration testing, smart
contract security reviews, and/or fuzzing code, this could be the perfect job
for you!

## The Company

**Sigma Prime** is an information security consultancy who provides specialist
distributed systems expertise. We are a team of developers, researchers, and security
engineers who have come together with the purpose of building a secure and
decentralised world.

Ethereum has been a focus of ours since 2015 and we have provided security
reviews, design consultancy, and niche development services to prominent
companies in the space, both locally and internationally.

Our latest project, Lighthouse, is an Ethereum 2.0 client built using Rust.
The project is well established and considered one of the leading implementations in production today; the open-source repository can be found at [github.com/sigp/lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse). The project is supported through grant funding, with contributors such as the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, and many private individuals.

Our information security practice provides the following services:

* Blockchain security assessments
* Penetration testing
* Smart contract security reviews
* Infrastructure security assessments
* Social engineering & red team exercises
* Fuzz testing

We are a safe place regardless of your ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or any other characteristic that makes you happy and harms no-one.

## The Role

We are looking to expand our core security team by hiring a blockchain security
engineer who shares our passion for information security and decentralised
systems, and our insatiable curiosity of how things work (and break).

You may fit the role if you have:

* A keen interest in information security
* A methodical approach to compromising distributed systems
* A practical knowledge of automated security analysis tools
* Experience with manual source code reviews of large code bases, focussing on security issues
* Reverse engineering or malware analysis experience
* A working knowledge of advanced network protocols and infrastructure operations
* Experience in assessing consensus mechanisms
* A practical experience in fuzz testing (libfuzzer, HonggFuzz, AFL, etc.)
* Experience with more than one scripting language (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Perl, etc.)
* A passion for Ethereum, proof-of-stake blockchains, and/or decentralised systems

This role is for a security engineer whose primary objectives will be to:

* Perform (offensive) security assessments (blockchain protocols, penetration testing of web/mobile/decentralised applications, cloud infrastructure security reviews, etc.)
* Contribute to [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) by extending the current fuzzing capability
* Work on the development and maintainance of a differential fuzzer for Ethereum 2.0

The ideal candidate would be a seasoned security assessor and an Ethereum enthusiast with experience in decentralised system security (e.g. smart contract auditing), who is looking to help secure software at the core of the leading projects in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Locations

The candidate is free to choose between being remote or local in Sydney. While Sigma Prime is primarily based in NSW, Australia, remote work is an essential part of our company culture. Those who work remotely still form an integral part of the team.

Sigma Prime can also help the right candidate relocate to Sydney, where our office is, if desired.
