# Wanted: Security Engineer

Sigma Prime is hiring a security engineer to expand its security assessment practice. If you're into penetration testing, smart contract security reviews, and/or fuzzing code, this could be the perfect job for you!

## The Company

**Sigma Prime** is a boutique information security firm who provides specialist
blockchain expertise. We are a team of developers, researchers, and security
engineers who have come together with the purpose of building a secure and
decentralised world.

Ethereum has been a focus of ours since 2015, and we have provided security
reviews, design consultancy, and niche development services to prominent companies in the space, both locally and internationally.

Our latest project, Lighthouse, is an Ethereum 2.0 client built using Rust. While the software is still in the pre-alpha development phase, the
project is already well established. The open-source
repository can be found at [github.com/sigp/lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse). We are honoured to have received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation for this initiative.

Our information security practice provides the following services:

* Penetration testing
* Smart contract security reviews
* Infrastructure security assessments
* Social engineering & red team exercises
* Fuzz testing


## The Role

We are looking to expand our core security team by hiring a security engineer who shares
our passion for information security and decentralised systems, and our insatiable curiosity of how things work (and break).

You may fit the role if you have:

* A keen interest in information security
* A methodical approach to compromising information systems
* A practical knowledge of automated security analysis tools
* Experience with source code reviews, focussing on security issues
* Reverse engineering or malware analysis experience
* A working knowledge of advanced network protocols and infrastructure operations
* A practical experience in fuzz testing (libfuzzer and/or AFL)
* Experience with more than one scripting language (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Perl, etc.)
* A passion for Ethereum, proof-of-stake blockchains, and/or decentralised systems.

This role is for a security engineer whose primary objectives will be to:

* Perform (offensive) security assessments (penetration testing of web/mobile/decentralised applications, cloud infrastructure security reviews, etc.).
* Contribute to [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) by extending the current fuzzing capability.
* Work on the design and implementation of a differential fuzzer for Ethereum 2.0.

The ideal candidate would be a seasoned security assessor and an Ethereum enthusiast with experience in smart contract auditing, who is looking to help secure software at the
core of the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Location

Sigma Prime is based in Sydney, Australia, and while local candidates are preferred,
remote work is an essential part of our company culture. Those who work remotely still
form an integral part of the team.

Sigma Prime can also help the right candidate relocate to Sydney if desired.
