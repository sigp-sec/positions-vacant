If you're interested in blockchain security, penetration testing, smart contract security reviews, and fuzzing code, this internship could be the perfect opportunity for you, whether you're an experienced professional or someone just starting out in the space.

## The Company

**Sigma Prime** is an information security consultancy that specializes in distributed systems. Our team consists of developers, researchers, and security engineers dedicated to building a secure and decentralised world.

We have been actively involved in Ethereum since 2015, providing security reviews, design consultancy, and niche development services to prominent companies in the blockchain space, both locally and internationally.

Our latest project, Lighthouse, is an Ethereum consensus client built using Rust. It is widely recognized as one of the leading implementations in production today, and the open-source repository can be found at [github.com/sigp/lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse). The project is supported through grant funding, with contributors such as the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, Optimism, and many private individuals.

As part of our information security practice, we offer the following services:

* Blockchain security assessments (L1, L2, Bridges, etc.)
* Smart contract security reviews
* Penetration testing
* Infrastructure security assessments
* Social engineering and red team exercises
* Fuzz testing

We are committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that brings them happiness and does no harm to others.

## The Internship

We are seeking an intern to join our core security team and assist in various aspects of our service offering. This internship is designed for individuals who share our passion for information security and decentralised systems and have a strong curiosity about how things work (and break). The internship can last between 8 to 12 weeks, providing you with ample time to immerse yourself in the field and gain valuable practical experience.

As an intern, you will have the opportunity to:

* Receive internal training on various areas related to blockchain security
* Shadow experienced team members in client engagements and security assessments
* Contribute to the development of existing security tooling, including extending the fuzzing capability of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)
